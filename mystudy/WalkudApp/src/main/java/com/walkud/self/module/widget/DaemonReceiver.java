 * I faced exactly the same problem and it seems to be that in the Google Play Services Library,
 * they missed to put android:exported="true" in their <service> declaration.
 *
 * Before Android 5.0, it was allowed to start services with implicit intents,
 * but now it's not possible, and instead of having a warning, you will have an Exception.
 * They need to fix their stuff.
